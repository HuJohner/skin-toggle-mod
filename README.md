# Skin Toggle Mod (for Fabric)

The Skin Toggle Mod is a free and open-source Minecraft mod which adds keybindings for the Skin Customization settings in Minecraft.
My old version of this mod used to be called "Skin Customisation Key Binded Mod" and a video showcasing it can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9mxqFCslJ0).

### Features
Adds keybindings for the skin customizations settings in Minecraft.
This allows the player to toggle the following skin customizations without needing to access a menu:
Cape, Jacket, left and right sleeve, left and right pants leg, hat.

### Downloads

You can find downloads for this mod on either the [official CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/skin-toggle-mod-fabric)
or through the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/hujohner/skin-toggle-mod/releases).

### Installation instructions

This mod relies on the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). Users should select Fabric for either the Minecraft launcher (client) or
the dedicated server (server) depending on their needs.
Once you have installed Fabric, place the mod .jar in the `mods` folder generated by Fabric.
You will also need the official [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api), which also needs to be placed in the `mods` folder alongside the Skin Toggle Mod.
